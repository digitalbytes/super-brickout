# SuperBRICKOUT 1987 Source

This is the original source code for SuperBRICKOUT writtin in 1987 when I was 15 years old in high school. The code was written using EDTASM+ on the Color Computer 3 that I still have to this day.

I removed the line numbers from the source files and setup a Makefile to allow the code to build with `lwasm` and provided a target `run` to launch in `mame`.

This code is not the same as the BRICKOUT.BIN at the top level of this repo. That version allows you to select your starting level. This one asks you to press a button to start. 

I had some trouble with the emulator getting that to work so there is a comment there. I may fix that so that it works more consistently.

Enjoy,
Owen Stenseth
