Working through commenting the code. Trying to understand how the scores are written to the screen. 

I have determined that I split the score into 5 digits and stored the value for each of those digits separate from the score value.

Good progress on figuring out how the score and high score are handled. When the program returns to the title screen the score is updated and the high score is also updated if necessary. Saddly no "NEW HIGH SCORE" is displayed to the user. We can add this to our list of enhacments.
