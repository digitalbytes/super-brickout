# SuperBRICKOUT 

The purpose of this project is to review and improve SuperBRICKOUT. It will happen in three separate phases.

## Phase 1 - What Was I Thinking?

In this phase I will review the current code and try and determine how it works. Commenting the code and updateing the 6 letter labels to something more understandable will be the first priority. Once that's done we can run the code and see what fixes need to be made. 

## Phase 2 - Get It Working

Here we will fix up things in the game that may not be working as well as they could be. Some candidates for this include double buffering to remove flicker and better handling of the joystick. We will also review the code here to ensure we are doing things the proper way.

## Phase 3 - Enhancements

This is when we get to add new features to the game. Some of the things I would like to do include:

 - Sound.
 - COCO 3 color graphics.
 - Animations.
 - Backgounds.

## Phase 4 - Level Editor

Create an editor that will allow users to create their own levels that they can save to disk to share with others. This will come with variable height and width levels (currently we are restricted to 7x15)
